# **Introduction**

This document outlines the final project architecture for the Eye Shots Platform MVP. It is based on the detailed requirements in the PRD and the specific technical foundation provided by the **Ecme Next.js TypeScript starter template**. This architecture integrates the Ecme template with a modern, hybrid stack consisting of **Convex Cloud**, **Clerk**, and self-hosted services on a **Contabo VPS**.  
**Starter Template:** The project will be initialized using the **Ecme Next.js TypeScript "starter" version**. This architecture is designed to adapt and extend that foundation.
