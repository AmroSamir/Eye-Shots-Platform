# **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals:**

* To centralize project management, client collaboration, and internal workflows into a single, efficient platform.  
* To provide clients with a transparent and intuitive portal for tracking project progress and providing feedback.  
* To significantly reduce the time and effort required for creative asset review and approval cycles.  
* To establish a scalable technical foundation for future expansion into CRM, advanced finance, and marketing modules.

Background Context:  
The Eye Shots Platform is being developed to address the operational inefficiencies of using multiple, disconnected tools for managing a creative agency. The core problem is the friction in the client collaboration loop, especially during the creative review process. This platform will provide a unified solution, with the MVP focusing on the most critical workflow: creating projects, managing files, and streamlining the asset approval process, thereby delivering immediate value to both the internal team and clients.
