# **User Interface Design Goals**

The UI will adhere to the clean, modern aesthetic of the Ecme template. The primary goal is to create an intuitive and efficient user experience, especially within the Asset Review module. The design should prioritize clarity, with a logical information hierarchy that allows users to quickly find projects, files, and review statuses. Progressive disclosure will be used to avoid overwhelming users, showing detailed controls only when needed.
