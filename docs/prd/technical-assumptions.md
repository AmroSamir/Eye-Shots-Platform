# **Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** A monorepo structure is assumed, as it is a common pattern for full-stack Next.js applications and is well-supported by modern tooling.  
* **Service Architecture:** The application will start as a monolith, leveraging Next.js API routes for the backend. This is the simplest approach for the MVP and aligns with the Ecme template's structure.  
* **Testing Requirements:** Development will include unit and integration tests. The focus will be on ensuring the reliability of the core Asset Review and file management functionalities.
