# Story 1.2: User Authentication Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** to manage user accounts for both internal team members and clients,
**so that** only authorized users can access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ The system integrates with the template's useAuth provider.
2. ✅ Users can sign up for a new account.
3. ✅ Users can sign in with their credentials.
4. ✅ Users can sign out.
5. ✅ The system can differentiate between "Internal Team" and "Client" user types upon registration or by admin assignment.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Key learnings from Story 1.1**:
- Ecme Next.js template successfully initialized with Next.js 15.3.1
- Template includes NextAuth-based authentication system (current setup)
- Development server running successfully on localhost:3000
- All dependencies installed and verified (701 packages)

### Technical Architecture Requirements
**Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Authentication**: Clerk (Latest) - Manages all user sign-up, sign-in, session management, and future subscriptions
- Must replace existing NextAuth implementation with Clerk integration

**High-Level Architecture Integration** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- Auth Flow: Frontend (Ecme Next.js) → Clerk Authentication via Clerk SDK
- Clerk provides webhooks and auth state management
- Backend integration: Convex functions can call Clerk for user management

**Database Schema Requirements** [Source: architecture/database-schema-convex.md]:
```typescript
users: defineTable({
  clerkId: v.string(),           // Clerk user identifier
  email: v.string(),
  displayName: v.string(),
  type: v.union(v.literal("Internal"), v.literal("Client")),
  role: v.union(v.literal("Admin"), v.literal("Project Manager"), v.literal("Creative"), v.literal("Client")),
}).index("by_clerk_id", ["clerkId"])
```

### Current Template Analysis
**Existing Authentication Setup**:
- Template uses NextAuth with GitHub, Google, and Credentials providers
- Auth configuration in `src/configs/auth.config.ts`
- Main auth setup in `src/auth.ts`
- Sign-in pages: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`

**Migration Required**:
- Replace NextAuth implementation with Clerk
- Update AuthProvider and SessionContext components
- Modify existing auth forms to use Clerk components
- Update middleware and route protection

### File Locations
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/auth.ts` - Replace with Clerk configuration
- `src/configs/auth.config.ts` - Replace with Clerk config
- `src/components/auth/AuthProvider/` - Update to use Clerk
- `src/components/auth/SignIn/` - Integrate Clerk sign-in
- `src/components/auth/SignUp/` - Integrate Clerk sign-up
- `src/middleware.ts` - Update auth middleware for Clerk

**Files to Create**:
- `convex/schema.ts` - Convex schema with user table
- `convex/users.ts` - User management functions
- Environment variables configuration for Clerk

### Integration Requirements
**Clerk Setup Dependencies**:
- Install `@clerk/nextjs` package
- Configure Clerk publishable and secret keys
- Set up Clerk webhook endpoints for user synchronization
- Create Convex functions for user data management

**User Type Implementation**:
- Custom user metadata in Clerk for user types
- Convex integration for user type storage and validation
- Admin interface for user type assignment (future story preparation)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Use Jest & React Testing Library for authentication flow testing
- Test sign-up, sign-in, sign-out workflows
- Verify user type assignment and differentiation
- Test integration between Clerk and Convex user management

### Technical Constraints
**Architecture Compliance**:
- Must use Clerk (not NextAuth) per tech stack requirements
- Must integrate with planned Convex backend structure
- Must maintain Ecme component compatibility
- Must preserve existing route protection patterns

### Project Structure Notes
**Structural Conflicts Identified**:
- Template uses NextAuth, architecture requires Clerk (breaking change)
- Requires migration of existing authentication patterns
- Need to preserve Ecme template's auth UI components while changing backend
- Must ensure compatibility with planned Convex integration

**Migration Strategy**:
- Gradual replacement: Install Clerk alongside NextAuth initially
- Update components one by one to use Clerk
- Remove NextAuth dependencies once migration complete
- Maintain existing route structure and user flows
